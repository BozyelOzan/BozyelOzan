# Hi there, I'm Ozan! 👋

#### 🧬 Biomedical Engineer | 🧠 Deep Learning Engineer | 🏥 Medical AI Researcher

I am a Biomedical Engineer passionate about bridging the gap between healthcare and artificial intelligence. Since graduating, I have been working as an **Independent Researcher**, dedicating my time to mastering Deep Learning architectures and solving complex problems in medical diagnostics.

My primary focus is building robust AI pipelines that translate raw medical data (DICOM, Signals) into actionable clinical insights.
